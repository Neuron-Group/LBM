This is a simple 2D LBM fluid dynamic solver programed by C++.

In src, there is 3 demo domains. The first file models the airflow around the wing, while the remaining two files model the flow around a cylinder and the flow in a lid-driven cavity, respectively. You can swap the file names of "PLANE.cpp PLANE0.cpp PLANE1.cpp" to change the domain you want to solve, you can also program yourself domain.
